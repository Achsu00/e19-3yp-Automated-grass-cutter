Based on the error message you provided, it seems that your mobile device is unable to connect to the server at IP address `10.0.0.18` and port `50574` ยน. This error message is usually caused by a network connectivity issue or a firewall blocking the connection.

Here are some possible solutions that you can try:

- Ensure that your mobile device and the server are connected to the same network.
- Check if the IP address and port number are correct.
- Disable any firewalls or antivirus software that may be blocking the connection.
- Try restarting your mobile device and the server.
- If you are using Windows 10, try updating your firewall settings to allow Expo Go to communicate with the development server ยน.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions!
